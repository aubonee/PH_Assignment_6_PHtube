   <h1> Scope of var, let, and const:</h1>

<p>var: Variables declared with var have function scope or global scope, depending on where they are declared. This means they are accessible throughout the entire function in which they are declared or globally if declared outside of any function. Variables declared with var are also hoisted, which means they are moved to the top of their containing function or global scope during compilation.

    let: Variables declared with let have block scope, meaning they are only accessible within the block (enclosed by curly braces) in which they are declared. let variables are not hoisted, so they are only accessible after the point in the code where they are declared.
    
    const: Variables declared with const are also block-scoped like let. However, they have an additional characteristic: they cannot be reassigned after their initial value is assigned. This makes const ideal for declaring constants or variables that should not be changed.</p>

<h1>Use Cases of null and undefined:</h1>

<p>null: null is a value that represents the intentional absence of any object value. It is often used to indicate that a variable should have no value or that an object property does not currently reference any object. For example, if a variable user is set to null, it can signify that there is no currently logged-in user.

    undefined: undefined represents a variable or object property that has been declared but has not been assigned any value. It can also be the default return value of a function that doesn't explicitly return anything. It indicates that a value is missing or has not been initialized. It's often better to explicitly set a variable to null when you want to indicate the absence of a value, while undefined typically arises when you forget to assign a value or when accessing properties that don't exist.</p>

    <h1>REST API (Representational State Transfer API):</h1>
<p>

    REST API stands for Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface. It is an architectural style for designing networked applications. REST is not a protocol but a set of principles and constraints used for creating web services that are scalable, stateless, and easy to maintain. Here are some key aspects of REST APIs:
    
    Stateless: Each request from a client to a server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request. The server does not store any client state between requests.
    
    Resources: Resources are identified by URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers) and can represent any entity, such as data objects, services, or even real-world objects.
    
    HTTP Methods: REST APIs typically use standard HTTP methods like GET (retrieve data), POST (create data), PUT (update data), DELETE (remove data), etc., to perform actions on resources.
    
    Representation: Resources can have multiple representations, such as JSON, XML, HTML, etc., and clients can request a specific representation using content negotiation.
    
    Stateless Communication: Each request/response between client and server should be self-contained, with no dependency on previous requests. This allows for scalability and fault tolerance.</p>
