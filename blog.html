         <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold text-green-700 text-center py-2"> Scope of var, let, and const:</h1>
 
        <p class="text-justify"> <span class="font-bold">var:</span> Variables are declared with var have global scope, depending on where they are declared.var variables can be updated and re-declared within its scope. They are accessible throughout the entire function in which they are declared or globally if declared outside of any function. Variables declared with var are also hoisted, which means they are moved to the top of their containing function or global scope during compilation.
          <br> <br>  <span class="font-bold">let:</span> Variables declared with let have block scope, meaning they are only accessible within the block (enclosed by curly braces) in which they are declared. let variables are not hoisted, so they are only accessible after the point in the code where they are declared. 
          <br><br><span class="font-bold">const:</span> Variables declared with const are also block-scoped like let. However, they have an additional characteristic. They cannot be reassigned after their initial value is assigned. This makes const ideal for declaring constants or variables that should not be changed.

            <p class="text-justify"> <span class="font-bold">Null: </span>Null in JavaScript means an empty value and is also a primitive type in JavaScript. The variable which has been assigned as null contains no value.When we assign null as a value to any variable, it means that it is empty or blank.
            
             <br><br>   <span class="font-bold">Undefined:</span> Undefined means the variable has been declared, but its value has not been assigned. It can also be the default return value of a function that doesn't explicitly return anything. undefined means "not defined". So we declare a variable but do not assign a value to it, the variable becomes undefined.</p>

            <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold text-green-700 text-center py-2">REST API (Representational State Transfer API):</h1>
            <p class="text-justify">
            
                REST stands for Representational State Transfer and API stands for  Application Programming Interface. RESTful APIs use HTTP requests to interact with data, while traditional APIs can use a variety of protocols. REST API is an architectural style for designing networked applications.  Here are some key aspects of REST APIs:
                
               <br><span class="font-bold"> Stateless:</span> Each request from a client to a server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request. The server does not store any client state between requests.
                
               <br><span class="font-bold"> Resources:</span> Resources are identified by URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers) and can represent any entity, such as data objects, services, or even real-world objects.
                
               <br><span class="font-bold"> HTTP Methods:</span> REST APIs typically use standard HTTP methods like GET (retrieve data), POST (create data), PUT (update data), DELETE (remove data), etc., to perform actions on resources.
